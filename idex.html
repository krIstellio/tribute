        <p>Family members often take steps after a passing to ensure their loved one’s final wishes are carried out. For Seth Collins, honoring the final wishes of his brother, Aaron, who committed suicide in 2012, was about more than just completing a simple task. It was about creating a lasting movement of goodwill. <br>The family found a will on Aaron’s computer asking that family <strong> “Leave an awesome tip (and I don't mean 25 percent. I mean $500 on a pizza) for a waiter or waitress."</strong>

    <p>The family found a will on Aaron’s computer asking that family <strong> “Leave an awesome tip (and I don't mean 25 percent. I mean $500 on a pizza) for a waiter or waitress."</strong> <br></br>After Seth gave his first tip in Aaron’s memory to a waitress in Kentucky, he realized he wanted to keep the gesture going in remembrance of his brother. He posted a video online which lead to a flood of donations from across the country and the beginning of the Aaron’s Last Wish road trip project. <br></br>To date, Seth has given away more than 80 $500 tips to waiters and waitresses in nearly all 50 states.</p>
